# Constraints on dark energy from TDCOSMO & SLACS lenses

Natalie B. Hogg

This repository contains the yaml files needed to replicate the MCMC chains produced for my analysis, plus the MCMC chains themselves,
and a notebook with which all the figures shown in the paper can be plotted.

Note that the chain files produced using the full combination of data are quite large, so cloning this repository may be slow.

If you use any of the data products in this repository, please cite the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11977):
